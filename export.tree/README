# Columnar Finger Representation

This dataset consists refers to the layer-fMRI study published in NeuroImgae: https://doi.org/10.1101/457002

The datatype is rather unconventional compared to standard fMRI datasets.
It is a VASO study, where the functional data are used as structiural data.
TRs and resulution is variable across time and contrasts within one run. 

Thus, the data are not easly compatible with BIDS. 
Therefore, see the 'actualfiles' folder for the files.
